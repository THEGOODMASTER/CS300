## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
### In these assignments I designed a system for a university's computer science department. It gets input from a .txt file and saves it in a vector. It's then able to sort and display all the courses in the department. It's also able to take a user input and search for the desired courses within the vector.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
### I approached these issues with the knowledge of data structures as my guide. The study of data structures is really important for situations like these. Without it a programmer would not have the skill to properly solve the problem in an efficient manner.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
### I have a programmer friend who has been in the field for over 20 years who has tutored me. He tried to help me on occasion but he often came to the same conclusion I did and was equally confused what the assignment was asking for. I even got the help of tutors who verified my work with confidence and yet still I was continually given a poor grade. I also reached out to my instructor who's responses were either delayed or unhelpful. In spite of these and MANY other personal setbacks, I feel that I thoroughly understand the topics covered and did my utmost to submit assignments that were done the best to my ability.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
### This project has helped me understand the vast benefit of using the data structure and algorithm combination. For example I used a vector and the quick-sort algorithm to search for a specific course. With this knowledge I am confident I can design more efficient software.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
### Practice has proven to be the best teacher for programming and this is just another program to add to my portfolio. As always I worked to make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, but this time I had the added knowledge of data structures and algorithms to my aid. Because I had to start from scratch for this project, I feel that I have a stronger and more professional understanding of what it means to design code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
